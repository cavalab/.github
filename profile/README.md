The Cava laboratory is a research group run by run by William La Cava ([@lacava](https://github.com/lacava)). It is part of the [Computational Health Informatics Program](http://www.chip.org) at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.



We are interested in improving the _interpretability_ and _fairness_ of predictive models deployed in healthcare settings.
We create and study algorithms that can embed these notions when working with health data.
